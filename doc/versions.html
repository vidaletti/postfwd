<h1>postfwd1 vs postfwd2</h1><br>
As you might have noticed, there are two different versions of postfwd available - postfwd(1) and postfwd2.
Which version fits best for you depends on your setup. Both versions use the same ruleset parser*. They also share the basic command line arguments (use both with --help for details). This allows to switch easily between them.
<br><br>
The following table might help you to decide which version to use. Basically you should stick with postfwd1 for the moment unless you encounter performance issues with dns based checks or very complex rulesets with thousands
of checks. Please note that, due to implementation, rate limits are handled faster by postfwd1 at the moment. If performance really matters and you use a complex ruleset with rate limits and lots of dns based checks you should consider
running two instances at different ports/sockets: postfwd1 for the rate limits and postfwd2 for the rest.
