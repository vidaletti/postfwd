DESCRIPTION
  INTRODUCTION
    postfwd is written to combine complex postfix restrictions in a ruleset
    similar to those of the most firewalls. The program uses the postfix
    policy delegation protocol to control access to the mail system before a
    message has been accepted (please visit
    <http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html> for more information).

    postfwd allows you to choose an action (e.g. reject, dunno) for a
    combination of several smtp parameters (like sender and recipient
    address, size or the client's TLS fingerprint). Also it offers simple
    macros/acls which should allow straightforward and easy-to-read
    configurations.

    *Features:*

    * Complex combinations of smtp parameters

    * Combined RBL/RHSBL lookups with arbitrary actions depending on results

    * Scoring system

    * Date/time based rules

    * Macros/ACLs, Groups, Negation

    * Compare request attributes (e.g. client_name and helo_name)

    * Internal caching for requests and dns lookups

    * Built in statistics for rule efficiency analysis

  CONFIGURATION
    A configuration line consists of optional item=value pairs, separated by
    semicolons (`;`) and the appropriate desired action:

            [ <item1>=<value>; <item2>=<value>; ... ] action=<result>

    *Example:*

            client_address=192.168.1.1 ; sender==no@bad.local ; action=REJECT

    This will deny all mail from 192.168.1.1 with envelope sender
    no@bad.local. The order of the elements is not important. So the
    following would lead to the same result as the previous example:

            action=REJECT ; client_address=192.168.1.1 ; sender==no@bad.local

    The way how request items are compared to the ruleset can be influenced
    in the following way:

            ====================================================================
             ITEM == VALUE                true if ITEM equals VALUE
             ITEM => VALUE                true if ITEM >= VALUE
             ITEM =< VALUE                true if ITEM <= VALUE
             ITEM >  VALUE                true if ITEM >  VALUE
             ITEM <  VALUE                true if ITEM <  VALUE
             ITEM =~ VALUE                true if ITEM ~= /^VALUE$/i
             ITEM != VALUE                false if ITEM equals VALUE
             ITEM !> VALUE                false if ITEM >= VALUE
             ITEM !< VALUE                false if ITEM <= VALUE
             ITEM !~ VALUE                false if ITEM ~= /^VALUE$/i
             ITEM =  VALUE                default behaviour (see ITEMS section)
            ====================================================================

    To identify single rules in your log files, you may add an unique
    identifier for each of it:

            id=R_001 ; action=REJECT ; client_address=192.168.1.1 ; sender==no@bad.local

    You may use these identifiers as target for the `jump()` command (see
    ACTIONS section below). Leading or trailing whitespace characters will
    be ignored. Use '#' to comment your configuration. Others will
    appreciate.

    A ruleset consists of one or multiple rules, which can be loaded from
    files or passed as command line arguments. Please see the COMMAND LINE
    section below for more information on this topic.

    Since postfwd version 1.30 rules spanning span multiple lines can be
    defined by prefixing the following lines with one or multiple whitespace
    characters (or '}' for macros):

            id=RULE001
                    client_address=192.168.1.0/24
                    sender==no@bad.local
                    action=REJECT no access

    postfwd versions prior to 1.30 require trailing ';' and '\'-characters:

            id=RULE001; \
                    client_address=192.168.1.0/24; \
                    sender==no@bad.local; \
                    action=REJECT no access

  ITEMS
            id                      - a unique rule id, which can be used for log analysis
                                      ids also serve as targets for the "jump" command.

            date, time              - a time or date range within the specified rule shall hit
                                      # FORMAT:
                                      # Feb, 29th
                                      date=29.02.2008
                                      # Dec, 24th - 26th
                                      date=24.12.2008-26.12.2008

                                      date=01.04.2008-

            days, months            - a range of weekdays (Sun-Sat) or months (Jan-Dec)
                                      within the specified rule shall hit

            score                   - when the specified score is hit (see ACTIONS section)
                                      the specified action will be returned to postfix
                                      scores are set global until redefined!

            request_score           - this value allows to access a request's score. it
                                      may be used as variable ($$request_score).

            rbl, rhsbl,             - query the specified RBLs/RHSBLs, possible values are:
            rhsbl_client,             <name>[/<reply>/<maxcache>, <name>/<reply>/<maxcache>]
            rhsbl_sender,             (defaults: reply=^127\.0\.0\.\d+$ maxcache=3600)
            rhsbl_reverse_client      the results of all rhsbl_* queries will be combined
                                      in rhsbl_count (see below).

            rblcount, rhsblcount    - minimum RBL/RHSBL hitcounts to match. if not specified
                                      a single RBL/RHSBL hit will match the rbl/rhsbl items.
                                      you may specify 'all' to evaluate all items, and use
                                      it as variable in an action (see ACTIONS section)
                                      (default: 1)

            sender_localpart,       - the local-/domainpart of the sender address
            sender_domain

            recipient_localpart,    - the local-/domainpart of the recipient address
            recipient_domain

            helo_address            - postfwd tries to look up the helo_name. use
                                      helo_address=!!(0.0.0.0/0) to check for unknown.
                                      Please do not use this for positive access control
                                      (whitelisting), as it might be forged.

            sender_ns_names,        - postfwd tries to look up the names/ip addresses
            sender_ns_addrs           of the nameservers for the sender domain part.
                                      Please do not use this for positive access control
                                      (whitelisting), as it might be forged.

            sender_mx_names,        - postfwd tries to look up the names/ip addresses
            sender_mx_addrs           of the mx records for the sender domain part.
                                      Please do not use this for positive access control
                                      (whitelisting), as it might be forged.

            version                 - postfwd version, contains "postfwd n.nn"
                                      this enables version based checks in your rulesets
                                      (e.g. for migration). works with old versions too,
                                      because a non-existing item always returns false:
                                      # version >= 1.10
                                      id=R01; version~=1\.[1-9][0-9]; sender_domain==some.org \
                                            ; action=REJECT sorry no access

            ratecount               - only available for rate(), size() and rcpt() actions.
                                      contains the actual limit counter:
                                            id=R01; action=rate(sender/200/600/REJECT limit of 200 exceeded [$$ratecount hits])
                                            id=R02; action=rate(sender/100/600/WARN limit of 100 exceeded [$$ratecount hits])

    Besides these you can specify any attribute of the postfix policy
    delegation protocol. Feel free to combine them the way you need it (have
    a look at the EXAMPLES section below).

    Most values can be specified as regular expressions (PCRE). Please see
    the table below for details:

            # Postfix version 2.3 and later:
            # ------------------------------
            encryption_protocol=TLSv1/SSLv3         mask = PCRE
            encryption_cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA    mask = PCRE
            encryption_keysize=256                  mask = numeric, will match if keysize >= 256
            ...

    the current list can be found at
    <http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html>. Please read carefully
    about which attribute can be used at which level of the smtp transaction
    (e.g. size will only work reliably at END-OF-MESSAGE level). Pattern
    matching is performed case insensitive.

    Multiple use of the same item is allowed and will compared as logical
    OR, which means that this will work as expected:

            id=TRUST001; action=OK; encryption_keysize=64
                    ccert_fingerprint=11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99
                    ccert_fingerprint=22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00
                    ccert_fingerprint=33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00:11
                    sender=@domain\.local$

    client_address, rbl and rhsbl items may also be specified as
    whitespace-or-comma-separated values:

            id=SKIP01; action=dunno
                    client_address=192.168.1.0/24, 172.16.254.23
            id=SKIP02; action=dunno
                    client_address=10.10.3.32 10.216.222.0/27

    The following items currently have to be unique:

            id, minimum and maximum values, rblcount and rhsblcount

    Any item can be negated by preceeding '!!' to it, e.g.:

            id=HOST001 ;  hostname == !!secure.trust.local ;  action=REJECT only secure.trust.local please

    or using the right compare operator:

            id=HOST001 ;  hostname != secure.trust.local ;  action=REJECT only secure.trust.local please

    To avoid confusion with regexps or simply for better visibility you can
    use '!!(...)':

            id=USER01 ;  sasl_username = !!( (bob|alice) )  ;  action=REJECT who is that?

    Request attributes can be compared by preceeding '$$' characters, e.g.:

            id=R-003 ;  client_name = !! $$helo_name      ;  action=WARN helo does not match DNS
            # or
            id=R-003 ;  client_name = !!($$(helo_name))   ;  action=WARN helo does not match DNS

    This is only valid for PCRE values (see list above). The comparison will
    be performed as case insensitive exact match. Use the '-vv' option to
    debug.

    These special items will be reset for any new rule:

            rblcount        - contains the number of RBL answers
            rhsblcount      - contains the number of RHSBL answers
            matches         - contains the number of matched items
            dnsbltext       - contains the dns TXT part of all RBL and RHSBL replies in the form
                              rbltype:rblname:<txt>; rbltype:rblname:<txt>; ...

    These special items will be changed for any matching rule:

            request_hits    - contains ids of all matching rules

    This means that it might be necessary to save them, if you plan to use
    these values in later rules:

            # set vals
            id=RBL01 ; rhsblcount=all; rblcount=all
                    action=set(HIT_rhls=$$rhsblcount,HIT_rbls=$$rblcount,HIT_txt=$$dnsbltext)
                    rbl=list.dsbl.org, bl.spamcop.net, dnsbl.sorbs.net, zen.spamhaus.org
                    rhsbl_client=rddn.dnsbl.net.au, rhsbl.ahbl.org, rhsbl.sorbs.net
                    rhsbl_sender=rddn.dnsbl.net.au, rhsbl.ahbl.org, rhsbl.sorbs.net

            # compare
            id=RBL02 ; HIT_rhls>=1 ; HIT_rbls>=1 ; action=554 5.7.1 blocked using $$HIT_rhls RHSBLs and $$HIT_rbls RBLs [INFO: $$HIT_txt]
            id=RBL03 ; HIT_rhls>=2               ; action=554 5.7.1 blocked using $$HIT_rhls RHSBLs [INFO: $$HIT_txt]
            id=RBL04 ; HIT_rbls>=2               ; action=554 5.7.1 blocked using $$HIT_rbls RBLs [INFO: $$HIT_txt]

  FILES
    Since postfwd1 v1.15 and postfwd2 v0.18 long item lists can be stored in
    separate files:

            id=R001 ;  ccert_fingerprint==file:/etc/postfwd/wl_ccerts ;  action=DUNNO

    postfwd will read a list of items (one item per line) from
    /etc/postfwd/wl_ccerts. comments are allowed:

            # client1
            11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99
            # client2
            22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00
            # client3
            33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00:11

    To use existing tables in key=value format, you can use:

            id=R001 ;  ccert_fingerprint==table:/etc/postfwd/wl_ccerts ;  action=DUNNO

    This will ignore the right-hand value. Items can be mixed:

            id=R002 ;  action=REJECT
                    client_name==unknown
                    client_name==file:/etc/postfwd/blacklisted

    and for non pcre (comma separated) items:

            id=R003 ;  action=REJECT
                    client_address==10.1.1.1, file:/etc/postfwd/blacklisted

            id=R004 ;  action=REJECT
                    rbl=myrbl.home.local, zen.spamhaus.org, file:/etc/postfwd/rbls_changing

    You can check your configuration with the --show_config option at the
    command line:

            # postfwd --showconfig --rule='action=DUNNO; client_address=10.1.0.0/16, file:/etc/postfwd/wl_clients, 192.168.2.1'

    should give something like:

            Rule   0: id->"R-0"; action->"DUNNO"; client_address->"=;10.1.0.0/16, =;194.123.86.10, =;186.4.6.12, =;192.168.2.1"

    If a file can not be read, it will be ignored:

            # postfwd --showconfig --rule='action=DUNNO; client_address=10.1.0.0/16, file:/etc/postfwd/wl_clients, 192.168.2.1'
            [LOG warning]: error: file /etc/postfwd/wl_clients not found - file will be ignored ?
            Rule   0: id->"R-0"; action->"DUNNO"; client_address->"=;10.1.0.0/16, =;192.168.2.1"

    File items are evaluated at configuration stage. Therefore postfwd needs
    to be reloaded if a file has changed.

    If you want to specify a file, that will be reloaded for each request,
    you can use lfile: and ltable:

            id=R001; client_address=lfile:/etc/postfwd/client_whitelist; action=dunno

    This will check the modification time of /etc/postfwd/client_whitelist
    every time the rule is evaluated and reload it as necessary. Of course
    this might increase the system load, so please use it with care.

    The --showconfig option illustrates the difference:

            ## evaluated at configuration stage
            # postfwd2 --nodaemon -L --rule='client_address=table:/etc/postfwd/clients; action=dunno' -C
            Rule   0: id->"R-0"; action->"dunno"; client_address->"=;1.1.1.1, =;1.1.1.2, =;1.1.1.3"

            ## evaluated for any rulehit
            # postfwd2 --nodaemon -L --rule='client_address=ltable:/etc/postfwd/clients; action=dunno' -C
            Rule   0: id->"R-0"; action->"dunno"; client_address->"=;ltable:/etc/postfwd/clients"

    Files can refer to other files. The following is valid.

            -- FILE /etc/postfwd/rules.cf --
            id=R001; client_address=file:/etc/postfwd/clients_master.cf; action=DUNNO

            -- FILE /etc/postfwd/clients_master.cf --
            192.168.1.0/24
            file:/etc/postfwd/clients_east.cf
            file:/etc/postfwd/clients_west.cf

            -- FILE /etc/postfwd/clients_east.cf --
            192.168.2.0/24

            -- FILE /etc/postfwd/clients_west.cf --
            192.168.3.0/24

    Note that there is currently no loop detection (/a/file calls /a/file)
    and that this feature is only available with postfwd1 v1.15 and postfwd2
    v0.18 and higher.

  ACTIONS
    *General*

    Actions will be executed, when all rule items have matched a request (or
    at least one of any item list). You can refer to request attributes by
    preceeding $$ characters, like:

            id=R-003; client_name = !!$$helo_name; action=WARN helo '$$helo_name' does not match DNS '$$client_name'
            # or
            id=R-003; client_name = !!$$helo_name; action=WARN helo '$$(helo_name)' does not match DNS '$$(client_name)'

    *postfix actions*

    Actions will be replied to postfix as result to policy delegation
    requests. Any action that postfix understands is allowed - see "man 5
    access" or <http://www.postfix.org/access.5.html> for a description. If
    no action is specified, the postfix WARN action which simply logs the
    event will be used for the corresponding rule.

    postfwd will return dunno if it has reached the end of the ruleset and
    no rule has matched. This can be changed by placing a last rule
    containing only an action statement:

            ...
            action=dunno ; sender=@domain.local     # sender is ok
            action=reject                           # default deny

    *postfwd actions*

    postfwd actions control the behaviour of the program. Currently you can
    specify the following:

            jump (<id>)
            jumps to rule with id <id>, use this to skip certain rules.
            you can jump backwards - but remember that there is no loop
            detection at the moment! jumps to non-existing ids will be skipped.

            score (<score>)
            the request's score will be modified by the specified <score>,
            which must be a floating point value. the modificator can be either
                    +n.nn   adds n.nn to current score
                    -n.nn   sustracts n.nn from the current score
                    *n.nn   multiplies the current score by n.nn
                    /n.nn   divides the current score through n.nn
                    =n.nn   sets the current score to n.nn
            if the score exceeds the maximum set by `--scores` option (see
            COMMAND LINE) or the score item (see ITEMS section), the action
            defined for this case will be returned (default: 5.0=>"REJECT postfwd score exceeded").

            set (<item>=<value>,<item>=<value>,...)
            this command allows you to insert or override request attributes, which then may be
            compared to your further ruleset. use this to speed up repeated comparisons to large item lists.
            please see the EXAMPLES section for more information. you may separate multiple key=value pairs
            by "," characters.

            rate (<item>/<max>/<time>/<action>)
            this command creates a counter for the given <item>, which will be increased any time a request
            containing it arrives. if it exceeds <max> within <time> seconds it will return <action> to postfix.
            rate counters are very fast as they are executed before the ruleset is parsed.
            please note that <action> was limited to postfix actions (no postfwd actions) for postfwd versions <1.33!
                # no more than 3 requests per 5 minutes
                # from the same "unknown" client
                id=RATE01 ;  client_name==unknown
                   action=rate(client_address/3/300/450 4.7.1 sorry, max 3 requests per 5 minutes)
            Please note also that the order of rate limits in your ruleset is important, which means
            that this:
                    # works as expected
                    id=R001; action=rcpt(sender/500/3600/REJECT limit of 500 recipients per hour for sender $$sender exceeded)
                    id=R002; action=rcpt(sender/200/3600/WARN state YELLOW for sender $$sender)
            leads to different results than this:
                    # rule R002 never gets executed
                    id=R001; action=rcpt(sender/200/3600/WARN state YELLOW for sender $$sender)
                    id=R002; action=rcpt(sender/500/3600/REJECT limit of 500 recipients per hour for sender $$sender exceeded)

            size (<item>/<max>/<time>/<action>)
            this command works similar to the rate() command with the difference, that the rate counter is
            increased by the request's size attribute. to do this reliably you should call postfwd from
            smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions. if you want to be sure, you could check it within the ruleset:
               # size limit 1.5mb per hour per client
               id=SIZE01 ;  protocol_state==END-OF-MESSAGE ;  client_address!=10.1.1.1
                  action=size(client_address/1572864/3600/450 4.7.1 sorry, max 1.5mb per hour)

            rcpt (<item>/<max>/<time>/<action>)
            this command works similar to the rate() command with the difference, that the rate counter is
            increased by the request's recipient_count attribute. to do this reliably you should call postfwd
            from smtpd_data_restrictions or smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions. if you want to be sure, you could
            check it within the ruleset:
               # recipient count limit 3 per hour per client
               id=RCPT01 ;  protocol_state==END-OF-MESSAGE ;  client_address!=10.1.1.1
                  action=rcpt(client_address/3/3600/450 4.7.1 sorry, max 3 recipients per hour)

            rate5321,size5321,rcpt5321 (<item>/<max>/<time>/<action>)
            same as the corresponding non-5321 functions, with the difference that the localpart of
            sender oder recipient addresses are evaluated case-sensitive according to rfc5321. That
            means that requests from bob@example.local and BoB@example.local will be treated differently

            ask (<addr>:<port>[:<ignore>])
            allows to delegate the policy decision to another policy service (e.g. postgrey). the first
            and the second argument (address and port) are mandatory. a third optional argument may be
            specified to tell postfwd to ignore certain answers and go on parsing the ruleset:
               # example1: query postgrey and return it's answer to postfix
               id=GREY; client_address==10.1.1.1; action=ask(127.0.0.1:10031)
               # example2: query postgrey but ignore the answer, if it matches 'DUNNO'
               # and continue parsing postfwd's ruleset
               id=GREY; client_address==10.1.1.1; action=ask(127.0.0.1:10031:^dunno$)

            mail(server/helo/from/to/subject/body)
            This command is deprecated. You should try to use the sendmail() action instead.
            Very basic mail command, that sends a message with the given arguments. LIMITATIONS:
            This basically performs a telnet. No authentication or TLS are available. Additionally it does
            not track notification state and will notify you any time, the corresponding rule hits.

            sendmail(sendmail-path::from::to::subject::body)
            Mail command, that uses an existing sendmail binary and sends a message with the given arguments.
            LIMITATIONS: The command does not track notification state and will notify you any time, the
            corresponding rule hits (which could mean 100 mails for a mail with 100 recipients at RCPT stage).

            wait (<delay>)
            pauses the program execution for <delay> seconds. use this for
            delaying or throtteling connections.

            note (<string>)
            just logs the given string and continues parsing the ruleset.
            if the string is empty, nothing will be logged (noop).

            quit (<code>)
            terminates the program with the given exit-code. postfix doesn`t
            like that too much, so use it with care.

    You can reference to request attributes, like

            id=R-HELO ;  helo_name=^[^\.]+$ ;  action=REJECT invalid helo '$$helo_name'

  MACROS/ACLS
    Multiple use of long items or combinations of them may be abbreviated by
    macros. Those must be prefixed by '&&' (two '&' characters). First the
    macros have to be defined as follows:

            &&RBLS { rbl=zen.spamhaus.org,list.dsbl.org,bl.spamcop.net,dnsbl.sorbs.net,ix.dnsbl.manitu.net; };

    Then these may be used in your rules, like:

            &&RBLS ;  client_name=^unknown$                         ; action=REJECT
            &&RBLS ;  client_name=(\d+[\.-_]){4}                    ; action=REJECT
            &&RBLS ;  client_name=[\.-_](adsl|dynamic|ppp|)[\.-_]   ; action=REJECT

    Macros can contain actions, too:

            # definition
            &&GONOW { action=REJECT your request caused our spam detection policy to reject this message. More info at http://www.domain.local; };
            # rules
            &&GONOW ;  &&RBLS ;  client_name=^unknown$
            &&GONOW ;  &&RBLS ;  client_name=(\d+[\.-_]){4}
            &&GONOW ;  &&RBLS ;  client_name=[\.-_](adsl|dynamic|ppp|)[\.-_]

    Macros can contain macros, too:

            # definition
            &&RBLS{
                    rbl=zen.spamhaus.org
                    rbl=list.dsbl.org
                    rbl=bl.spamcop.net
                    rbl=dnsbl.sorbs.net
                    rbl=ix.dnsbl.manitu.net
            };
            &&DYNAMIC{
                    client_name=^unknown$
                    client_name=(\d+[\.-_]){4}
                    client_name=[\.-_](adsl|dynamic|ppp|)[\.-_]
            };
            &&GOAWAY { &&RBLS; &&DYNAMIC; };
            # rules
            &&GOAWAY ; action=REJECT dynamic client and listed on RBL

    Basically macros are simple text substitutions - see the "PARSER"
    section for more information.

  PLUGINS
    Description

    The plugin interface allow you to define your own checks and enhance
    postfwd's functionality. Feel free to share useful things!

    Warning

    Note that the plugin interface is still at devel stage. Please test your
    plugins carefully, because errors may cause postfwd to break! It is also
    allowed to override attributes or built-in functions, but be sure that
    you know what you do because some of them are used internally.

    Please keep security in mind, when you access sensible ressources and
    never, ever run postfwd as privileged user! Also never trust your input
    (especially hostnames, and e-mail addresses).

    ITEMS

    Item plugins are perl subroutines which integrate additional attributes
    to requests before they are evaluated against postfwd's ruleset like any
    other item of the policy delegation protocol. This allows you to create
    your own checks.

    plugin-items can not be used selective. these functions will be executed
    for every request postfwd receives, so keep performance in mind.

            SYNOPSIS: %result = postfwd_items_plugin{<name>}(%request)

    means that your subroutine, called <name>, has access to a hash called
    %request, which contains all request attributes, like
    $request{client_name} and must return a value in the following form:

            save: $result{<item>} = <value>

    this creates the new item <item> containing <value>, which will be
    integrated in the policy delegation request and therefore may be used in
    postfwd's ruleset.

                            # allows to check postfwd version in ruleset
                            "version" => sub {
                                    my(%request) = @_;
                                    my(%result) = (
                                            "version" => $NAME." ".$VERSION,
                                    );
                                    return %result;

                                    my(%result) = ();
                                    $request{sender} =~ /@([^@]*)$/;
                                    $result{sender_domain} = ($1 || '');
                                    $request{recipient} =~ /@([^@]*)$/;
                                    $result{recipient_domain} = ($1 || '');
                                    return %result;
                            },

            );

    COMPARE

    Compare plugins allow you to define how your new items should be
    compared to the ruleset. These are optional. If you don't specify one,
    the default (== for exact match, =~ for PCRE, ...) will be used.

            SYNOPSIS:  <item> => sub { return &{$postfwd_compare{<type>}}(@_); },

    ACTIONS

    Action plugins allow to define new postfwd actions. By setting the
    $stop-flag you can decide to continue or to stop parsing the ruleset.

            SYNOPSIS:  (<stop rule parsing>, <next rule index>, <return action>, <logprefix>, <request>) =
                            <action> (<current rule index>, <current time>, <command name>, <argument>, <logprefix>, <request>)

                                    $index += $myarg if ( $myarg and not(($index + $myarg) > $#Rules) );
                                    return ($stop,$index,$myaction,$myline,%request);
                            },
        
                            # dumps current request contents to syslog
                            "dumprequest" => sub {
                                    my($index,$now,$mycmd,$myarg,$myline,%request) = @_;

            # do NOT remove the next line
            );

  COMMAND LINE
    *Ruleset*

    The following arguments are used to specify the source of the postfwd
    ruleset. This means that at least one of the following is required for
    postfwd to work.

            -f, --file <file>
            Reads rules from <file>. Please see the CONFIGURATION section
            below for more information.

            -r, --rule <rule>
            Adds <rule> to ruleset. Remember that you might have to quote
            strings that contain whitespaces or shell characters.

    *Scoring*

            -s, --scores <val>=<action>
            Returns <action> to postfix, when the request's score exceeds <val>

    Multiple usage is allowed. Just chain your arguments, like:

            postfwd -r "<item>=<value>;action=<result>" -f <file> -f <file> ...
              or
            postfwd --scores 4.5="WARN high score" --scores 5.0="REJECT postfwd score too high" ...

    In case of multiple scores, the highest match will count. The order of
    the arguments will be reflected in the postfwd ruleset.

    *Control*

            -d, --daemon
            postfwd will run as daemon and listen on the network for incoming
            queries (default 127.0.0.1:10040).

            -k, --kill
            Stops a running postfwd daemon.

            --reload
            Reloads configuration.

            --dumpstats
            Displays program usage statistics.

            --dumpcache
            Displays cache contents.

            --delcache <item>
            Removes an item from the request cache. Use --dumpcache to identify objects.
            E.g.:
                    # postfwd --dumpcache
                    ...
                    %rate_cache -> %sender=gmato@jqvo.org -> %RATE002+2_600 -> @count    -> '1'
                    %rate_cache -> %sender=gmato@jqvo.org -> %RATE002+2_600 -> @maxcount -> '2'
                    ...
                    # postfwd --delrate="sender=gmato@jqvo.org"
                    rate cache item 'sender=gmato@jqvo.org' removed

            --delrate <item>
            Removes an item from the rate cache. Use --dumpcache to identify objects.

    *Networking*

    postfwd can be run as daemon so that it listens on the network for
    incoming requests. The following arguments will control it's behaviour
    in this case.

            -i, --interface <dev>
            Bind postfwd to the specified interface (default 127.0.0.1).

            -p, --port <port>
            postfwd listens on the specified port (default tcp/10040).

            --proto <type>
            The protocol type for postfwd's socket. Currently you may use 'tcp' or 'unix' here.
            To use postfwd with a unix domain socket, run it as follows:
                postfwd --proto=unix --port=/somewhere/postfwd.socket

            -u, --user <name>
            Changes real and effective user to <name>.

            -g, --group <name>
            Changes real and effective group to <name>.

            --umask <mask>
            Changes the umask for filepermissions (unix domain sockets, pidfiles).
            Attention: This is umask, not chmod - you have to specify the bits that
            should NOT apply. E.g.: umask 077 equals to chmod 700.

            -R, --chroot <path>
            Chroot the process to the specified path.
            Test this before using - you might need some libs there.

            --pidfile <path>
            The process id will be saved in the specified file.

            --facility <f>
            sets the syslog facility, default is 'mail'

            --socktype <s>
            sets the Sys::Syslog socktype to 'native', 'inet' or 'unix'.
            Default is to auto-detect this depening on module version and os.

            -l, --logname <label>
            Labels the syslog messages. Useful when running multiple
            instances of postfwd.

            --loglen <int>
            Truncates any syslog message after <int> characters.

    *Plugins*

            --plugins <file>
            Loads postfwd plugins from file. Please see http://postfwd.org/postfwd.plugins
            or the plugins.postfwd.sample that is available from the tarball for more info.

    *Optional arguments*

    These parameters influence the way postfwd is working. Any of them can
    be combined.

            -v, --verbose
            Verbose logging displays a lot of useful information but can cause
            your logfiles to grow noticeably. So use it with caution. Set the option
            twice (-vv) to get more information (logs all request attributes).

            -c, --cache <int>    (default=600)
            Timeout for request cache, results for identical requests will be
            cached until config is reloaded or this time (in seconds) expired.
            A setting of 0 disables this feature.

            --cache-no-size
            Ignores size attribute for cache comparisons which will lead to better
            cache-hit rates. You should set this option, if you don't use the size
            item in your ruleset.

            --cache-no-sender
            Ignores sender address for cache comparisons which will lead to better
            cache-hit rates. You should set this option, if you don't use the sender
            item in your ruleset.

            --cache-rdomain-only 
            This will strip the localpart of the recipient's address before filling the
            cache. This may considerably increase cache-hit rates.

            --cache-rbl-timeout <timeout>     (default=3600)
            This default value will be used as timeout in seconds for rbl cache items,
            if not specified in the ruleset.

            --cache-rbl-default <pattern>    (default=^127\.0\.0\.\d+$)
            Matches <pattern> to rbl/rhsbl answers (regexp) if not specified in the ruleset.

            --cacheid <item>, <item>, ...
            This csv-separated list of request attributes will be used to construct
            the request cache identifier. Use this only, if you know exactly what you
            are doing. If you, for example, use postfwd only for RBL/RHSBL control,
            you may set this to
                    postfwd --cache=3600 --cacheid=client_name,client_address
            This increases efficiency of caching and improves postfwd's performance.
            Warning: You should list all items here, which are used in your ruleset!

            --cleanup-requests <interval>    (default=600)
            The request cache will be searched for timed out items after this <interval> in
            seconds. It is a minimum value. The cleanup process will only take place, when
            a new request arrives.

            --cleanup-rbls <interval>    (default=600)
            The rbl cache will be searched for timed out items after this <interval> in
            seconds. It is a minimum value. The cleanup process will only take place, when
            a new request arrives.

            --cleanup-rates <interval>    (default=600)
            The rate cache will be searched for timed out items after this <interval> in
            seconds. It is a minimum value. The cleanup process will only take place, when
            a new request arrives.

            -S, --summary <int>    (default=600)
            Shows some usage statistics (program uptime, request counter, matching rules)
            every <int> seconds. This option is included by the -v switch.
            This feature uses the alarm signal, so you can force postfwd to dump the stats
            using `kill -ALRM <pid>` (where <pid> is the process id of postfwd).

            Example:
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Counters: 213000 seconds uptime, 39 rules
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Requests: 71643 overall, 49 last interval, 62.88% cache hits
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Averages: 20.18 overall, 4.90 last interval, 557.30 top
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Contents: 44 cached requests, 239 cached dnsbl results
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Rule ID: R-001   matched: 2704 times
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Rule ID: R-002   matched: 9351 times
            Aug 19 12:39:45 mail1 postfwd[666]: [STATS] Rule ID: R-003   matched: 3116 times
            ...

            --no-rulestats
            Disables per rule statistics. Keeps your log clean, if you do not use them.
            This option has no effect without --summary or --verbose set.

            -L, --stdoutlog
            Redirects all syslog messages to stdout for debugging. Never use this with postfix!

            -t, --test
            In test mode postfwd always returns "dunno", but logs according
            to it`s ruleset. -v will be set automatically with this option.

            -n, --nodns
            Disables all DNS based checks like RBL checks. Rules containing
            such elements will be ignored.

            -n, --nodnslog
            Disables logging of dns events.

            --dns_timeout     (default: 14)
            Sets the timeout for asynchonous dns queries in seconds. This value will apply to
            all dns items in a rule.

            --dns_timeout_max    (default: 10)
            Sets the maximum timeout counter for dnsbl lookups. If the timeouts exceed this value
            the corresponding dnsbl will be deactivated for a while (see --dns_timeout_interval).

            --dns_timeout_interval    (default=1200)
            The dnsbl timeout counter will be cleaned after this interval in seconds. Use this
            in conjunction with the --dns_timeout_max parameter.

            --dns_async_txt
            Perform dnsbl A and TXT lookups simultaneously (otherwise only for listings with at
            least one A record). This needs more network bandwidth due to increased queries but
            might increase throughput because the lookups can be parallelized.

            --dns_max_ns_lookups     (default=0)
            maximum ns names to lookup up with sender_ns_addrs item. use 0 for no maximum.

            --dns_max_mx_lookups     (default=0)
            maximum mx names to lookup up with sender_mx_addrs item. use 0 for no maximum.

            -I, --instantcfg
            The config files, specified by -f will be re-read for every request
            postfwd receives. This enables on-the-fly configuration changes
            without restarting. Though files will be read only if necessary
            (which means their access times changed since last read) this might
            significantly increase system load.

            --config_timeout    (default=3)
            timeout in seconds to parse a single configuration line. if exceeded, the rule will
            be skipped. this is used to prevent problems due to large files or loops.
        
            --keep_rates    (default=0)
            With this option set postfwd does not clear the rate limit counters on reload. Please
            note that you have to restart (not reload) postfwd with this option if you change
            any rate limit rules.

            --save_rates    (default=none)
            With this option postfwd saves existing rate limit counters to disk and reloads them
            on program start. This allows persistent rate limits across program restarts or reboots.
            Please note that postfwd needs read and write access to the specified file.

            --fast_limit_evaluation    (default=0)
            Once a ratelimit was set by the ruleset, future requests will be evaluated against it
            before consulting the ruleset. This mode was the default behaviour until v1.30.
            With this mode rate limits will be faster, but also eventually set up
            whitelisting-rules within the ruleset might not work as expected.
            LIMITATIONS: This option does not allow nested postfwd commands like
                    action=rate(sender/3/60/wait(3))
            This option doe not work with the strict-rfc5321 rate() functions.

    *Informational arguments*

    These arguments are for command line usage only. Never ever use them
    with postfix spawn!

            -C, --showconfig
            Displays the current ruleset. Use -v for verbose output.

            -P, --perfmon
            This option turns of any syslogging and output. It is included
            for performance testing.

            -V, --version
            Displays the program version.

            -h, --help
            Shows program usage.

            -m, --manual
            Displays the program manual.

  REFRESH
    In daemon mode postfwd reloads it's ruleset after receiving a HUP
    signal. Please see the description of the '-I' switch to have your
    configuration refreshed for every request postfwd receives.

  PARSER
    *Configuration*

    The postfwd ruleset can be specified at the commandline (-r option) or
    be read from files (-f). The order of your arguments will be kept. You
    should check the parser with the -C | --showconfig switch at the command
    line before applying a new config. The following call:

            postfwd --showconfig \
                    -r "id=TEST; recipient_count=100; action=WARN mail with 100+ recipients" \
                    -f /etc/postfwd.cf \
                    -r "id=DEFAULT; action=dunno";

    will produce the following output:

            Rule   0: id->"TEST" action->"WARN mail with 100+ recipients"; recipient_count->"100"
            ...
            ... <content of /etc/postfwd.cf> ...
            ...
            Rule <n>: id->"DEFAULT" action->"dunno"

    Multiple items of the same type will be added to lists (see the "ITEMS"
    section for more info):

            postfwd --showconfig \
                    -r "client_address=192.168.1.0/24; client_address=172.16.26.32; action=dunno"

    will result in:

            Rule   0: id->"R-0"; action->"dunno"; client_address->"192.168.1.0/24, 172.16.26.32"

    Macros are evaluated at configuration stage, which means that

            postfwd --showconfig \
                    -r "&&RBLS { rbl=bl.spamcop.net; client_name=^unknown$; };" \
                    -r "id=RBL001; &&RBLS; action=REJECT listed on spamcop and bad rdns";

    will result in:

            Rule   0: id->"RBL001"; action->"REJECT listed on spamcop and bad rdns"; rbl->"bl.spamcop.net"; client_name->"^unknown$"

    *Request processing*

    When a policy delegation request arrives it will be compared against
    postfwd`s ruleset. To inspect the processing in detail you should
    increase verbority using use the "-v" or "-vv" switch. "-L" redirects
    log messages to stdout.

    Keeping the order of the ruleset in general, items will be compared in
    random order, which basically means that

            id=R001; action=dunno; client_address=192.168.1.1; sender=bob@alice.local

    equals to

            id=R001; sender=bob@alice.local; client_address=192.168.1.1; action=dunno

    Lists will be evaluated in the specified order. This allows to place
    faster expressions at first:

            postfwd -vv -L -r "id=RBL001; rbl=localrbl.local zen.spamhaus.org; action=REJECT" /some/where/request.sample

    produces the following

            [LOGS info]: compare rbl: "remotehost.remote.net[68.10.1.7]"  ->  "localrbl.local"
            [LOGS info]: count1 rbl:  "2"  ->  "0"
            [LOGS info]: query rbl:   localrbl.local 7.1.10.68 (7.1.10.68.localrbl.local)
            [LOGS info]: count2 rbl:  "2"  ->  "0"
            [LOGS info]: match rbl:   FALSE
            [LOGS info]: compare rbl: "remotehost.remote.net[68.10.1.7]"  ->  "zen.spamhaus.org"
            [LOGS info]: count1 rbl:  "2"  ->  "0"
            [LOGS info]: query rbl:   zen.spamhaus.org 7.1.10.68 (7.1.10.68.zen.spamhaus.org)
            [LOGS info]: count2 rbl:  "2"  ->  "0"
            [LOGS info]: match rbl:   FALSE
            [LOGS info]: Action: dunno

    The negation operator !!(<value>) has the highest priority and therefore
    will be evaluated first. Then variable substitutions are performed:

            postfwd -vv -L -r "id=TEST; action=REJECT; client_name=!!($$heloname)" /some/where/request.sample

    will give

            [LOGS info]: compare client_name:     "unknown"  ->  "!!($$helo_name)"
            [LOGS info]: negate client_name:      "unknown"  ->  "$$helo_name"
            [LOGS info]: substitute client_name:  "unknown"  ->  "english-breakfast.cloud8.net"
            [LOGS info]: match client_name:  TRUE
            [LOGS info]: Action: REJECT

    *Ruleset evaluation*

    A rule hits when all items (or at least one element of a list for each
    item) have matched. As soon as one item (or all elements of a list)
    fails to compare against the request attribute the parser will jump to
    the next rule in the postfwd ruleset.

    If a rule matches, there are two options:

    * Rule returns postfix action (dunno, reject, ...) The parser stops rule
    processing and returns the action to postfix. Other rules will not be
    evaluated.

    * Rule returns postfwd action (jump(), note(), ...) The parser evaluates
    the given action and continues with the next rule (except for the jump()
    or quit() actions - please see the "ACTIONS" section for more
    information). Nothing will be sent to postfix.

    If no rule has matched and the end of the ruleset is reached postfwd
    will return dunno without logging anything unless in verbose mode. You
    may simply place a last `catch-all´ rule to change that behaviour:

            ... <your rules> ...
            id=DEFAULT ;  action=dunno

    will log any request that passes the ruleset without having hit a prior
    rule.

  INTEGRATION
    *Integration via daemon mode*

    The common way to use postfwd is to start it as daemon, listening at a
    specified tcp port. As postfwd will run in a single instance
    (multiplexing mode), it will take most benefit of it`s internal caching
    in that case. Start postfwd with the following parameters:

            postfwd -d -f /etc/postfwd.cf -i 127.0.0.1 -p 10040 -u nobody -g nobody -S

    For efficient caching you should check if you can use the options
    --cache-rdomain-only, --cache-no-sender and --cache-no-size.

    Now check your syslogs (default facility "mail") for a line like:

            Aug  9 23:00:24 mail postfwd[5158]: postfwd n.nn ready for input

    and use `netstat -an|grep 10040` to check for something like

            tcp  0  0  127.0.0.1:10040  0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN

    If everything works, open your postfix main.cf and insert the following

            127.0.0.1:10040_time_limit      = 3600                                          <--- integration
            smtpd_recipient_restrictions    = permit_mynetworks                             <--- recommended
                                              reject_unauth_destination                     <--- recommended
                                              check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10040     <--- integration

    Reload your configuration with `postfix reload` and watch your logs. In
    it works you should see lines like the following in your mail log:

            Aug  9 23:01:24 mail postfwd[5158]: rule=22, id=ML_POSTFIX, client=english-breakfast.cloud9.net[168.100.1.7], sender=owner-postfix-users@postfix.tld, recipient=someone@domain.local, helo=english-breakfast.cloud9.net, proto=ESMTP, state=RCPT, action=dunno

    If you want to check for size or rcpt_count items you must integrate
    postfwd in smtp_data_restrictions or smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions. Of
    course you can also specify a restriction class and use it in your
    access tables. First create a file /etc/postfix/policy containing:

            domain1.local           postfwdcheck
            domain2.local           postfwdcheck
            ...

    Then postmap that file (`postmap hash:/etc/postfix/policy`), open your
    main.cf and enter

            # Restriction Classes
            smtpd_restriction_classes       = postfwdcheck, <some more>...                          <--- integration
            postfwdcheck                    = check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10040             <--- integration

            127.0.0.1:10040_time_limit      = 3600                                                  <--- integration
            smtpd_recipient_restrictions    = permit_mynetworks,                                    <--- recommended
                                              reject_unauth_destination,                            <--- recommended
                                              ...                                                   <--- optional
                                              check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/policy,      <--- integration
                                              ...                                                   <--- optional

    Reload postfix and watch your logs.

    *Integration via xinetd*

    There might be several reasons for you to use postfwd via a tcp wrapper
    package like xinetd (see <http://www.xinetd.org/>). I won`t discuss that
    here. If you plan to do so, just add the following line to your
    /etc/services file:

            # postfwd port
            postfwd     10040/tcp

    Then create a file '/etc/xinetd.d/postfwd':

            {
                    interface       = 127.0.0.1
                    socket_type     = stream
                    protocol        = tcp
                    wait            = no
                    user            = nobody
                    server          = /usr/local/bin/postfwd
                    server_args     = -f /etc/postfwd.cf
                    disable         = no
            }

    and restart the xinetd daemon (usually a SIGHUP should be fine). If you
    experience problems you might want to check your system's log for xinetd
    errors like "socket already in use".

    The integration with postfix is similar to the *Integration via daemon
    mode* section above. Reload postfix and watch your logs to see if
    everything works.

  TESTING
    First you have to create a ruleset (see Configuration section). Check it
    with

            postfwd -f /etc/postfwd.cf -C

    There is an example policy request distributed with postfwd, called
    'request.sample'. Simply change it to meet your requirements and use

            postfwd -f /etc/postfwd.cf <request.sample

    You should get an answer like

            action=<whateveryouconfigured>

    For network tests I use netcat:

            nc 127.0.0.1 10040 <request.sample

    to send a request to postfwd. If you receive nothing, make sure that
    postfwd is running and listening on the specified network settings.

  PERFORMANCE
    Some of these proposals might not match your environment. Please check
    your requirements and test new options carefully!

            - use caching options
            - use the correct match operator ==, <=, >=
            - use ^ and/or $ in regular expressions
            - use item lists (faster than single rules)
            - use set() action on repeated item lists
            - use jumps and rate limits
            - use a pre-lookup rule for rbl/rhsbls with empty note() action
